# Octavia Butler Open Source AI Meetup RAG and Vector Databases at SudoRoom hackerspace


We will be getting our hands dirty on open-source generative AI. Along the way we'll be able to learn about RAG and vector databases along with general ai and embeddings, see the pitfalls, and how we can operate in an ethical way.
=======
The purpose of this [Octavia Butler Open-Source AI meetup](https://sudoroom.org/inspiration-from-goat-octavia-butler/) is to get our hands dirty with code and face-to-face interaction at the SudoRoom hackerspace in Oakland. AI is coming our way for all its good or bad qualities, but we should be proactive and try to figure out way to deal with it humanely.


* From the first session [https://sudoroom.org/inspiration-from-goat-octavia-butler/](https://sudoroom.org/inspiration-from-goat-octavia-butler/)

## Basics
We're using open-source models with the Ollama open-source framework

- Download [Ollama](https://www.ollama.com)

- At the command line run ollama (depends on which computer you have, open the ollama app on a mac and run a command on debian linux, will update)

- List the models you have downloaded to your computer
```
ollama list
