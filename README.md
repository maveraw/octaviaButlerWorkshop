# Octavia Butler Open Source AI Meetup RAG and Vector Databases at SudoRoom hackerspace

We will be getting our hands dirty on open-source generative AI. Along the way we'll be able to learn about RAG and vector databases along with general ai and embeddings, see the pitfalls, and how we can operate in an ethical way.
